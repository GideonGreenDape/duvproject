            transaction receive a notification confirming the payment.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>

          <h4 className="mt-5">Cancellations and Refunds:</h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Users are strictly discouraged from causing cancellations and
            refunds. Refunds will impact Users standing in the DUV LIVE platform
            as follows:
          </p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              where the Entertainer is at fault for the refund (for example, due
              to no response or they have cancelled their Performance), it will
              negatively impact their status and rankings;
            </li>
            <li>
              multiple refunds attributed to an Event Host will lead to
              temporary and/ or permanent restrictions on their account
              depending upon the severity.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Requests to cancel services may be made by notifying the platform
            through the Cancel button under the Upcoming Events option.
          </p>
          <p>
            All cancellations must be done at least 48hours before the Event
            commencement.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-5"> Refund Policy</h4>
          <p>
            Transacting Users may mutually agree to a refund for reasons they
            both are aware of. However, authorization of such refunds will be
            subject to a review by the DUV LIVE team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users/Hirers/Event Hosts should <strong>NEVER</strong> file a
            dispute or reverse a payment through their Credit card company or
            Bank. Attempts to seek refunds in this way will lead to the Buyer's
            account being permanently suspended and may attract legal actions.
          </p>
          <h4 className="mt-5">Other Penalties:</h4>
          <p>
            It is hereby expressed that the following penalties shall be
            apportioned to the breach of the above provisions:
          </p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              In the event that parties breach any of these provisions, the
              party in breach shall remedy the breach by paying adequate
              monetary compensation to the injured and receiving party. This is
              essentially a binding Clause between the Event host and the
              Entertainer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <ol type="i">
                <li>
                  That in the event that the <strong>Event Host</strong>{' '}
                  refuses, fails and or neglects to notify the booked
                  entertainer through the platform at least{' '}
                  <strong>48 hours</strong> to the event of any frustration to
                  the show, the event host shall{' '}
                  <strong>compensate the entertainer</strong> to{' '}
                  <strong>35% </strong>of the sum of the professional fee
                  payable to the entertainer, had he performed, if that
                  cancellation is done before the event date.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Event Host fails to notify the Entertainer at all on
                  the platform prior to the event date that he wishes to cancel
                  the Event, and the booked Entertainer subsequently mobilizes,
                  the Event Host must pay for the service, as if delivered, in
                  accordance with these terms and conditions.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              That the entertainer shall be{' '}
              <strong>suspended, deactivated or even blacklisted</strong>{' '}
              (whichever is deemed appropriate) and{' '}
              <strong>shall forfeit his professional fee.</strong>
              <ol type="i">
                <li>
                  if he refuses to show up on the scheduled event or show he/she
                  has been booked for without prior notification to the platform
                  or the event host at least 48hrs before the event, due to any
                  act not deemed an act of God.
                </li>
                <li>
                  if it is discovered that the information supplied by the
                  Entertainer is false and tainted to mislead the platform and
                  the Event host. That the Entertainer shall ensure prompt
                  arrival at the event venue as delays attract penalties of fine
                  worth half (50%) of the sum of the professional fee, refunded
                  to the Event host.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              That the Entertainer shall ensure prompt arrival at the event

              sum of the professional fee, refunded to the Event host.
